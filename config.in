# 1. Do you want to build zlib as well?
#
#    If you want to build the zlib library along with Compress::Zlib, follow
#    the instructions in the README file and then set the BUILD_ZLIB variable
#    below to True. Otherwise set the variable to False.

BUILD_ZLIB	= False
#BUILD_ZLIB	= True

# 2. Where are the files zlib.h and zconf.h?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where zlib.h 
#    and zconf.h are installed on your system. 
#    If you have set BUILD_ZLIB above to True, a relative path is
#    sufficient.

#INCLUDE 	= /usr/local/include
#INCLUDE 	= ./zlib-1.1.3
INCLUDE 	= ./libraries/1.1.3

# 3. Where is libz?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where libz is
#    installed on your system.
#    If you have set BUILD_ZLIB above to True, a relative path is
#    sufficient.

#LIB	= /usr/local/lib
#LIB	= ./zlib-1.1.3
LIB	= ./libraries/1.1.3

# end of file config.in
